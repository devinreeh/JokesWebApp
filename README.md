# Jokes Web App

C# is better than Java. C# programmers say this proudly so I wanted to check it out. 

This follows the tutorial created by [Free Code Camp]([url](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)).

It creates a basic web app following an MVC design pattern using Asp.NET only. Users can create accounts, login, and create jokes to look up later.

My opinion so far is C# and ASP.NET is better than Java and Spring, but unfortunately no cool jobs use C#.
